      <h1>Coding Facts Motivation</h1>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Every line of code you write takes you one step closer to your dream.
        </li>
        <li>Consistency beats talent — code a little every day.</li>
        <li>
          Bugs are proof that you're learning — fix them and grow stronger.
        </li>
        <li>The best way to learn code is to build something today.</li>
        <li>Every great developer started as a beginner — keep going.</li>
        <li>Your future self will thank you for not giving up today.</li>
        <li>Progress, not perfection — write, test, and improve.</li>
        <li>
          Failures are lessons in disguise — debug, adapt, and move forward.
        </li>
        <li>Code like you belong in the industry — because you do.</li>
        <li>One commit at a time builds your portfolio and your confidence.</li>
        <li>Every error message is a clue — not a roadblock.</li>
        <li>The more you practice, the less you fear complex problems.</li>
        <li>
          Keep shipping projects, even small ones — momentum creates mastery.
        </li>
        <li>Challenges aren't obstacles; they're stepping stones to growth.</li>
        <li>Write code that excites you — passion fuels persistence.</li>
        <li>Debugging isn't failing; it's problem-solving at its finest.</li>
        <li>Stay curious — ask questions, read docs, and keep exploring.</li>
        <li>You are closer than you think — just one more problem solved.</li>
        <li>Dream in code, but act in commits — keep pushing forward.</li>
        <li>The difference between a beginner and a pro? Never quitting.</li>
      </ol>
